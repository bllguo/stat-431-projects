## Firefox Browsing Session Length
Statistical analysis and predictive model building for length of Firefox browsing sessions. Data obtained from Mozilla Labs.

Browser usage patterns were collected and analyzed for 27,000 users who voluntarily installed the Test Pilot extension for a week in November 2010. 

Abstract: 
A multiple regression analysis was performed to predict the average browsing time of a user using predictors from the Mozilla Labs Test Pilot Study conducted in 2010. Predictors considered were 1) number of windows open, 2) number of tabs, 3) number of bookmarks, 4) % of private sessions, 5) number of downloads, 6) number of extensions, and 7) number of browser activations. The model considering 1), 2), and 7) was found to be statistically significant. The most notable result of the model is a parabolic relationship between browsing time and number of windows, suggesting that browsing time declined significantly after two windows are opened.
